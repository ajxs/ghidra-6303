# ghidra-6303
Ghidra 6303 support and 6303 projects
=====================================

There is support for the 6303 processor (as used in Psion organisers as well as other devices) in this repository. Put the 6303 directory into your Ghidra Processors directory and the 6303 support should appear when setting up a new project. The 'extra' 6303 instructions appear in the disassembly but I haven't added the procedural part so no decompilation will appear.

Psion Organiser
===============

The reason for doing this was to get a disassembly of Psion Organiser code going. There is a Ghidra project here that is a start of the work to disassemble Psion organiser things, starting with the 33-LA ROM. The reason for this one is that it doesn't have bank switching so is an easier ROM tostart on.
